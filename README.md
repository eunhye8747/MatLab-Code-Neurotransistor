# MatLab_code_Nat.Elec.
This is the Matlab code for running the mathematical model in my article published in Nature Electronics. 
The mathematical formulas were derived from the circuit model of the neurotransistors.
This Matlab code verifies that the mathmatical model can describe the current dynamics of the neurotransistors.  
Please enjoy !!
