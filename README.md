# MatLab_code_Nat.Elec.
This is the Matlab code for running the mathematical model in the article published in Nature Electronics. 

The mathematical formulas were derived from the circuit model of the neurotransistors.
This Matlab code verifies that the mathmatical model can describe the current dynamics of the neurotransistors.  

This code is writen by Prof. Nikhil Ranjan Das. [Department of Radio Physics and Electronics, University of Calcutta]
