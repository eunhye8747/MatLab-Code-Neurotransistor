# MatLab-Code-Neurotransistor
This is the Matlab code to support the mathematical model in the article published in Nature Electronics. 

The mathematical formulas were derived from the circuit model of the neurotransistors.
This Matlab code verifies that the mathematical model can describe the current dynamics of the neurotransistors.  
The result is shown in Figure S6 of Supplementary Information of the article. 

This code was written by Prof. Nikhil Ranjan Das. [Department of Radio Physics and Electronics, University of Calcutta]
